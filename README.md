# AUTO-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis, also known as EDA, has become an increasingly hot topic in data science. Just as the name suggests, it is the process of trial and error in an uncertain space, with the goal of finding insights. It usually happens at the early stage of the data science lifecycle. Although there is no clear-cut between the definition of data exploration, data cleaning, or feature engineering. EDA is generally found to be sitting right after the data cleaning phase and before feature engineering or model building. EDA assists in setting the overall direction of model selection and it helps to check whether the data has met the model assumptions. 
# This is a feature hosted on Heroku Server that carries out Exploratory Data Analysis.
All you need to do is to load a dataset.
